When I am trying to upload the data into the crm I am getting an Error 500 message. In order to figure out what this error is I need to go to the logs and look up what exactly is happening.

So it looks like the ID from the first CRM is too long to upload to this CRM. So I will have to adjust it.
I go into the .csv file and change the ID to a simple numeric cell.
